<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Many issues in the health, medical, and biological sciences are addressed by collecting and exploring relevant data. The development and application of techniques to better understand such data is the fundamental concern of the Group in Biostatistics. The program offers training in theory of statistics and biostatistics, the computer implementation of analytic methods, and opportunities to use this knowledge in areas of biological/medical research. The curriculum is taught principally by members of the Department of Statistics (College of Letters and Science) and the Division of Biostatistics (School of Public Health) and provides a wide range of ideas and approaches to the analysis of data.</p>
<h3>Research Facilities</h3>
<p>Graduate students in the group have direct access to a variety of specialized computing resources, as well as the services of the campus computing facilities. Research activity of the faculty currently includes biostatistical computing, statistical issues in AIDS research, survival analysis, environmental health, epidemiology, and statistical methods in genetics and computational biology. Projects in research areas provide opportunities for both practical experience and individual research. Cooperation with other departments allows unusually broad and effective training in both theoretical and applied directions.</p>
