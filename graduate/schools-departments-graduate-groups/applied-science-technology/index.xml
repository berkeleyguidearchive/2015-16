<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Applied Science and Technology Graduate Group is administered by the College of Engineering. The program is focused on interdisciplinary research, and draws faculty from the departments within the College of Engineering as well as from the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Statistics, and Mathematics. Recent topics of interest include the properties and applications of nanostructures, thin-film and interface science, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), short-wavelength coherent radiation, X-ray micro-imaging for the life and physical sciences, plasma physics and plasma-assisted materials processing, laser-induced chemical processes, laser probing of complex reacting systems, ultrafast phenomena, particle accelerators, nonlinear dynamics, chaotic systems, numerical methods, and topics in computational fluid mechanics and reacting flows. The Applied Science and Technology (AS&amp;T) program awards the Doctor of Philosophy degree.</p>
<p>A hallmark of the AS&amp;T Graduate Group is that the students design their graduate curriculum in consultation with their adviser to best match their research interests.  This enables the students to cross the boundaries between traditional disciplines to conduct truly interdisciplinary research.  Graduate research in the AS&amp;T Program benefits from state-of-the-art experimental and computational facilities on the Berkeley campus and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The interdisciplinary, collaborative nature of the AS&amp;T Program provides ample opportunity to develop new research directions by making the best use possible of these facilities and of the other research instrumentation available to AS&amp;T faculty.</p>
<p>Students admitted to AS&amp;T have an opportunity to choose a research adviser from a diverse group of world-renowned faculty members engaged in cutting-edge research at UC Berkeley.  Among more than 80 associated members of the AS&amp;T faculty, students will find internationally-recognized faculty members who have achieved great distinction in their scholarship.  All have published in top-tier archival journals. Most have been recognized by their peers through prestigious awards.  Many are members of one or more of the national academies (the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences).</p>

This course explores modern developments in the physics and applications of x-rays and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. It begins with a review of electromagnetic radiation at short wavelengths including dipole radiation, scattering and refractive index, using a semi-classical atomic model. Subject matter includes the generation of x-rays with synchrotron radiation, high harmonic generation, x-ray free electron lasers, laser-plasma sources.</span><span class="deschide"> Spatial and temporal coherence concepts are explained. Optics appropriate for this spectral region are described. Applications include nanoscale and astrophysical imaging, femtosecond and attosecond probing of electron dynamics in molecules and solids, EUV lithography, and materials characteristics.
