<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>
<p>The PhD group in Epidemiology is interdisciplinary and includes faculty from a number of departments at UC Berkeley as well as the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Students receive either an MS or PhD degree from the Graduate Division of the Berkeley campus. The group is within the academic jurisdiction of the Graduate Council and is administratively located in the Division of Epidemiology.</p>
<p>The group brings together faculty with disciplinary knowledge in epidemiology, biostatistics, demography, sociology, anthropology, behavioral science, molecular biology, genetics, vector biology, and other fields relevant to the study of human health and disease at a population level. MS and PhD students receive a strong background in epidemiologic and biostatistical methods and theory; additionally, students must choose a third disciplinary area in which to develop competence. Doctoral dissertation research is generally focused on developing new knowledge about the factors that influence the distribution of health or given disease outcomes within human populations.</p>
