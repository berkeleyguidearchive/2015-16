America's recognition of and response to major social problems usually involves a mix of hyperbole and denial, inaction and innovation, volunteerism and professionalization, feasts and famines of resources, media applause and attack, and unsustained successes and long-term failures. What is usually lacking is a consistent, thoughtful effort. Yet help is given and lives are changed</span><span class="deschide">, for better and sometimes worse. Social Welfare 20 considers the American approach to social problems through an examination of issues such as substance abuse, mental illness, poverty and inequality, homelessness, family violence, and child maltreatment. Each area will be explored in terms of history, causes and dimensions, and human service and social policy responses.

In this interdisciplinary course students examine the relationships among social science, law, and crime prevention policy. Emphasis is placed on how psychological science (clinical, developmental, social) can inform decisions about individuals at high risk for repeated involvement in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Topics of focus include risk assessment, adolescent development and juvenile justice, and prevention/intervention/correctional</span><span class="deschide"> psychology. Students will have an opportunity to master a specific problem area. Broadly, goals are for students to a) become comfortable in translating crime prevention problems into social scientific questions, and b) specifically understand how research findings can inform law and policy.
