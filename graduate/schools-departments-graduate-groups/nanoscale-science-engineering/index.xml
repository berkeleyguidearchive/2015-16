<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>
<p>The Graduate Group in Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) administers the Designated Emphasis (DE). Faculty members associated with the group come from many engineering and physical science departments and share an interest in the growing body of research surrounding the synthesis, characterization, modeling, and fabrication of nanostructured materials and devices.</p>
<p>Doctoral students in associated departments who wish to pursue an emphasis in nanoscale research can add the Designated Emphasis to their PhD degree goals. The DE curriculum is designed to fulfill one of the required area emphases of the student's PhD program while providing additional opportunities for study and collaboration across the associated disciplines.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Program</h3>
<p>While there is no undergraduate program in Nanoscale Science and Engineering, there are many opportunities for interested undergraduates to get involved in research, participate in relevant extracurricular clubs and activities, and enroll in preparatory coursework that explores nano-related science and engineering. Students are invited to contact the program office for more information and referrals.</p>

This course discusses various top-down and bottom-up approaches to synthesizing and processing nanostructured materials. The topics include fundamentals of self assembly, nano-imprint lithography, electron beam lithography, nanowire and nanotube synthesis, quantum dot synthesis (strain patterned and colloidal), postsynthesis modification (oxidation, doping, diffusion, surface interactions, and etching techniques). In addition</span><span class="deschide">, techniques to bridging length scales such as heterogeneous integration will be discussed. We will discuss new electronic, optical, thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties brought forth by the very small sizes.
