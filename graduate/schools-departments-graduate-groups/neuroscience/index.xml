<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><span>The Neuroscience Graduate Group is a unique, diverse PhD training program that offers intensive, integrated training in multiple areas of neuroscience research. </span>The program involves more than 50 faculty from different campus departments, with expertise ranging from molecular and cellular neuroscience to developmental neuroscience, systems and computational neuroscience, and human cognitive neuroscience.</p>
<p>The group provides a highly interdisciplinary, intellectually dynamic training environment of course work, research training, and mentoring within a strong research program that produces fundamental advances in knowledge and cutting-edge techniques. The program welcomes highly qualified applicants to join in better understanding the brain and its functions and disorders.</p>
<p>Faculty in the Neuroscience Graduate Program are involved in three broad research areas: Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Neuroscience; Systems and Computational Neuroscience; and Cognition, Brain, and Behavior. Individual faculty may be involved in more than one research area.</p>
<p><span>The Neuroscience Graduate Program also sponsors an annual campuswide Neuroscience retreat, weekly seminar series, and a graduate student <em>Neuroscience Journal </em>Club.</span></p>

The course will survey the field of the human brain, with introductory lectures on the concepts of aging, and brief surveys of normal neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurochemistry, and neuropsychology as well as methods such as imaging, epidemiology, and pathology. The neurobiological changes associated with aging will be covered from the same perspectives: neuropsychology, anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology. Major neurological</span><span class="deschide"> diseases of aging including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease will be covered, as will compensatory mechanisms, neuroendocrine changes with aging, depression and aging, epidemiology of aging, and risk factors for decline.

Preparation and critiques of presentations will focus on organization of conceptual issues, data presentation, and summarization. 2) Exposure to current topics in neuroscience: faculty speakers will</span><span class="deschide"> present on current issues and topics relevant to scientific development in the neurosciences, such as technical methods, application of analytical and statistical techniques, and organization and preparation of competitive fellowship and other grant applications. 3) Seminar preparation: a crucial aspect of graduate education is the interaction of students with invited seminar speakers - who are often leaders in their fields. A selected number of class meetings will be devoted to the review of scientific articles published by upcoming seminar speakers and/or other related articles in the field.
