<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Berkeley Law is unique among major U.S. law schools in housing its own interdisciplinary graduate program in the social, philosophical, and humanistic study of law, leading to PhDÂ degrees in Jurisprudence and Social Policy (JSP). The JSP Program promotes the study of law and legal institutions through the perspectives of several disciplines including history, economics, philosophy, sociology, and political science. As the first law and society program of its kind in North America, the JSP Program remains the clear leader of a vibrant and growing body of such programs because of its deep curricular resources and its scholarly accomplishment.</p>
<p>Members of the Berkeley Law faculty with primary responsibility for the JSP Program are trained in a variety of academic disciplines and affiliated with other Berkeley departments and research centers.</p>
