<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The PhD Program in Health Services and Policy Analysis (HSPA) at UC Berkeley is distinguished by its interdisciplinary application of the social science disciplines to real-world health issues. Students select a major area of concentration from among three traditional disciplines (economics, organizational behavior, or political science) or an interdisciplinary “population health” track, while receiving exposure to all three of the core social sciences. Students augment their training through skills and knowledge from UC Berkeley's top-ranked Economics, Political Science, and Sociology departments, as well as the Haas School of Business and the Goldman School of Public Policy. Graduates of the HSPA program are well prepared to assume academic careers in research and teaching.</p>
