<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Designated Emphasis (DE) in Communication, Computation, and Statistics provides an academic structure for an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas. Many of the most significant developments in modern information technology — including communication and data networks, multimedia information processing, and large-scale, distributed data analysis in science, engineering, and commerce — are no longer the province of a single academic field, but draw on ideas from diverse sources in computer science, electrical engineering, and statistics. The DE in Communication, Computation, and Statistics enables specialized, multidisciplinary training, and research opportunities in various emerging areas of information technology. Admitted students not only participate in a cutting-edge program and receive explicit recognition of specialization in the Designated Emphasis but also are well positioned to compete for the most desirable jobs in information technology, both in academia and in industry.</p>
