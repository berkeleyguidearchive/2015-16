<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="column column-number-1 column-span-1">
<p>UC Berkeley’s Department of Art Practice provides professional art training within the context of a world-renowned public research university. The department offers innovative, interdisciplinary courses leading to BA and MFA degrees. As practicing visual artists, the faculty of the Department of Art Practice hold as a principal goal the representation and analysis of human experiences through creative research in visual art. In making art, faculty members seek to expand the boundaries of cultures and the limits of perceptions <span>through rigorous experimentation with art forms, media, and content. Considering human experiences from an experiential standpoint, experimentation leads to questioning beliefs, rituals, and philosophies as well as social, economic, and institutional structures. In teaching, the mission is to help students pose profound questions by developing their creative voices, mastering their practices, relating to their audiences, and connecting to histories of art and cultures.</span></p>
<p>Four goals underlie the teaching in the Department of Art:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To advance the body of knowledge of human experience through aesthetic investigation.</li>
	<li>To help students learn to think visually.</li>
	<li>To help students understand the strategies that artists have devised to deal with aesthetic problems in both traditional and nontraditional methods of art making.</li>
	<li>To help students develop a creative intelligence through practicing a visual arts discipline.</li>
</ol>

This course will challenge students to use ceramics as a way to explore and understand three-dimensional space, and use a contemporary art framework for critiquing and discussing the work produced. We will develop a practical understanding of how clay and glaze behave, while building a conceptual framework through which to apply this knowledge. Studio practice includes hand building, modeling, carving, and glazing as possibilities for turning</span><span class="deschide"> ideas into three dimensional propositions. Illustrated talks will help acquaint students with the ideas artists have explored through history and in contemporary sculptural practices.

This class provides a basic foundation for digital photography with hands-on instruction in the use of digital cameras and online image dissemination. Topics include image capture, composition, image syntax, image analysis, image manipulation, metatext production, and image sequencing for visual narratives. We also study image dissemination through online networks including social networks, blogs,</span><span class="deschide"> news, storage, search, and print services. Rather than limiting the discussion of photography to the production of the photographic image itself, we explore in written assignments how the reception of images can change based on context, usage, and network dynamics. While we rely on required DSLR digital cameras to produce images for weekly photographic assignments, we also experiment with alternate digital image generation techniques from telescopes to microscopes. All coursework will be posted and discussed online as well as in weekly lectures, workshops, and critiques. Course readings cover the history of photography, the theory of photographic reproduction and the theory of networked and memetic dissemination.

This new course will enable students to think critically about, and engage in practical experiments in, the complex interactions between new media and perceptions and performances of embodiment, agency, citizenship, collective action, individual identity, time and spatiality. We will pay particular attention to the categories of personhood that make up the UC Berkeley American Cultures rubric (race and ethnicity), as well</span><span class="deschide"> as to gender, nation, and disability. The argument threading through the course will be the ways in which new media both reinforce pre-existing social hierarchies, and yet offer possibilities for the transcendence of those very categories. The new media -- and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester -- can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

Game studies has five core elements: the study of games as transmitters of culture, the study of play and interactivity, the study of games as symbolic systems; the study of games as artifacts; and methods for creating games. We will study these core elements through play, play tests, play analysis, and comparative studies. Our reading list includes classic game studies theory</span><span class="deschide"> and texts which support game design methods. After weekly writing and design exercises, our coursework will culminate in the design and evaluation of an original code-based game with a tangible interface.
