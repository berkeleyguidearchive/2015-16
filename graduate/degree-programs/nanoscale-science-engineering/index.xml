<p>The Graduate Group in Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) administers the designated emphasis (DE). Faculty members associated with the group come from many engineering and physical science departments and share an interest in the growing body of research surrounding the synthesis, characterization, modeling, and fabrication of nanostructured materials and devices.</p>
<p>Doctoral students in <a href="https://consrt.eecs.berkeley.edu/DE-NSE/faculty.html" target="_blank">associated departments</a>
 who wish to pursue an emphasis in nanoscale research can add the designated emphasis to their PhD degree goals. The DE curriculum is designed to fulfill one of the required area emphases of the student's PhD program while providing additional opportunities for study and collaboration across the associated disciplines.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Applicants to the DE must be in a PhD program in one of the associated departments at UC Berkeley, in good standing, and should petition for the addition of the Designated Emphasis in Nanoscale Science and Engineering (DE NSE) to their degree goals before applying to take the qualifying examination. At least one, and preferably more, of the faculty on the exam committee should be in the NSE Graduate Group.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Two forms must be completed and submitted to the program office: the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/elecforms/GRAD.DEG.MAJ.CHNG.pdf" target="_blank">Graduate Petition to Change Degree Goal</a>
 and the DE NSE application form, available from the program office.</p>

<p class="Normal1">You are encouraged to contact the program office for more information about the Graduate Group in NSE's activities and opportunities, as well as to learn more about nanoscale research and teaching endeavors at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p class="Normal1">For further information regarding admission to graduate programs at UC Berkeley, please see the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/" target="_blank">Graduate Division's Admissions website</a>

<h3>Coursework/Curriculum</h3>
<p>One core course, two elective courses, and participation in a one-unit seminar organized by the NSE Graduate Group are required. The elective courses are chosen from these areas: Nanoscale Synthesis and Processing, Nanoscale Characterization, Nanoscale Theory and Modeling, Nano Devices, and Systems and Applications. To meet the requirement each elective should be from a distinct area.</p>
<p>Students will meet with a group adviser to form a study plan, and periodically check on progress towards completion.</p>
<h3>Qualifying Exam</h3>
<p>The qualifying exam committee will include at least one faculty member of the graduate group.</p>
<h3>Dissertation</h3>
<p>The dissertation committee at least one and preferably two, to ensure that the thesis contributes in a significant manner to the field.</p>
<h3>Conferral of Degree</h3>
<p>Upon award of the doctoral degree, the transcript record of successful participants in the NSE DE will list &quot;PhD in [major] with Designated Emphasis in Nanoscale Science and Engineering.&quot;</p>

This course discusses various top-down and bottom-up approaches to synthesizing and processing nanostructured materials. The topics include fundamentals of self assembly, nano-imprint lithography, electron beam lithography, nanowire and nanotube synthesis, quantum dot synthesis (strain patterned and colloidal), postsynthesis modification (oxidation, doping, diffusion, surface interactions, and etching techniques). In addition</span><span class="deschide">, techniques to bridging length scales such as heterogeneous integration will be discussed. We will discuss new electronic, optical, thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties brought forth by the very small sizes.
