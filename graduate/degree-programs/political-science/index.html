				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="Normal1">In the Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science, over 50 faculty and lecturers teach and conduct research in each of our 11 subfields on a variety of special topics. Additionally, our faculty and students work with over 20 specialized and interdisciplinary institutes and centers around campus on issues important to political science and our world today.</p>
<p class="Normal1">The department admits graduate students for the doctoral degree only.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant comes from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, 230 on the computer-based test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <p>Any applicant who was previously registered at Berkeley as a graduate student, no matter how briefly, must apply for readmission, not admission, even if the new application is to a different program.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts:  </strong>Applicants may u<span>pload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. <em>If the applicant is admitted,</em> then <em>official </em>transcripts of all college-level work will be required. Admitted applicants must r</span>equest a current transcript from every post-secondary school attended, including community colleges, summer sessions, and extension programs. <span>Official transcripts must be in sealed envelopes as issued by the school(s) attended. </span> 	<div class="gmail_default">If you have attended Berkeley, upload your unofficial transcript with your application for the departmental initial review. <em>If you are admitted,</em> an official transcript with evidence of degree conferral <em>will not</em> be required.</div> 	</li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, not the Graduate Division.</li> 	<li><strong>Evidence of English language proficiency:</strong> All applicants from countries or political entities in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to applicants from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement: 1) courses in English as a Second Language, 2) courses conducted in a language other than English, 3) courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and 4) courses of a non-academic nature. If applicants have previously been denied admission to Berkeley on the basis of their English language proficiency, they must submit new test scores that meet the current minimum from one of the standardized tests.</li> </ol> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a> . </p>

				<a name="doctoraldegreerequirementstext"></a><h2>Doctoral Degree Requirements</h2><h3>Normative Time Requirements</h3>
<p class="Normal1"><span class="details-value">The Political Science department at UC Berkeley admits students for the doctoral degree only. The PhD program has two major phases: coursework and examinations, and dissertation research and writing. The two phases typically take approximately six to seven years (three years to candidacy and three to four for dissertation research and writing).</span></p>
<h3>Time to Advancement</h3>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Curriculum</h4>
<table class="sc_courselist" width="100%"><tbody><tr class="even areaheader firstrow"><td colspan="2"><span class="courselistcomment areaheader">Courses Required</span></td><td class="hourscol"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>The coursework and examination phase requires 40 units (typically 10 classes) of graduate-level coursework and competence in three of nine <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/research-and-teaching/subfields" target="_blank" title="Subfields">subfields</a>
. Subfield competence is demonstrated through written exams offered each semester. The preliminary field exams are typically taken in the student's second and third years of the program. All students must pass one exam in a major subfield (Comparative, American, International Relations, or History of Political Theory) and a second exam in any subfield. Competency in the third subfield may be demonstrated by a third written exam or by taking a prescribed series of three courses in that field with a combined GPA of 3.5.</p>

<p>The particular sequence of courses that a student takes in preparation for the comprehensive exams is not prescribed. Rather, the faculty assist students with selection of courses that best meet their intellectual and academic interests. There are no formal foreign language or statistics requirements although many students will find that their program of study and dissertation research will require the engagement of particular foreign language or methodology coursework.</p>
<p>When the coursework and preliminary examination requirements have been met, the student prepares a prospectus for dissertation research. The student convenes a committee known as the qualifying exam committee. The qualifying exam committee advises on the prospectus and examines the student on specific research plans. UC Berkeley is highly committed to interdisciplinary scholarly engagement and this is codified in the requirement that both the qualifying exam committee and the dissertation committee include a faculty member from another department at UC Berkeley. Engagement with members of the faculty from other departments should begin during the coursework stage so that the advice and input of the outside member is represented in the prospectus.</p>
<p>When sufficient preparation for the proposed research has been demonstrated to the qualifying exam committee, the student is advanced to doctoral candidacy. It is expected (and for most funding packages, required) that the student advance to doctoral candidacy within three years of beginning graduate study.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1">Dissertation Research and Writing</h4>
<p>Doctoral candidacy initiates the second phase of the program during which the student normally devotes full attention to the research and writing of the dissertation. The student's dissertation committee is typically comprised of the members of the qualifying exam committee although there are sometimes changes in committee membership as the research evolves. The doctorate is awarded when the student submits a satisfactory dissertation to the dissertation committee. A reasonable estimate of the research and writing phase of the program is three years although students whose dissertations require more extensive research may take longer to earn their degree.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1">General Curriculum Guidelines</h4>
<h5>First Year</h5>
<p>Students are required to complete 24 units of coursework in their first year of study. At least 12 of these units must be in political science graduate courses; the remainder may be in graduate or upper division undergraduate courses in other departments. The first year is designed to allow the student the opportunity to engage in foreign language study, area specialization, and to meet and study with faculty from other departments who may become members of the qualifying exam or dissertation committees. Students are evaluated at the completion of the first year on their overall academic performance. This overall evaluation will include GPA, successful completion of all 24 units, and evaluations of instructors. The Graduate Studies Committee weighs these factors to determine whether to invite the student to continue in the PhD program.</p>
<h5>Second Year</h5>
<p>During the second year, students must complete an advanced topical research essay. The student will narrow their interests, continue to explore ideas for a dissertation topic, and identify potential advisers.  Coursework continues as students begin preparing for both preliminary field exams and writing their dissertation prospectus. Additionally, students in their second year usually serve as a graduate student instructor (GSI), a 20 hour per week position.  </p>
<h5>Third Year</h5>
<p>During the third year, most students continue to GSI and complete their coursework in addition to taking their preliminary field exams. Political Science graduate students must show competency in three subfield specialties to be eligible to sit for the oral prospectus defense (known formally as the qualifying exam). Instead of sitting for three field exams, students have the option to &quot;course out&quot; of one field specialty by taking a prescribed set of three courses in the subfield.</p>
<p>Students may sit for the field exams as early as the beginning of the second year, but if desired, students may sit for an exam in their second year and again in the third year. Field exams are offered at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters. Students may also opt to take two exams in the same semester although leaving both exams for the spring of the third year is not recommended. All students are expected to have completed their two field exams, to have coursed out of a third field, and to have written and defended their dissertation prospectus by the end of the third year. All student funding packages include the Dean's Completion Fellowship (DCF), commonly known as the fourth year of funding in such packages. Successful defense of the research plan and submission of the necessary candidacy paperwork by June 30 of the third year confers the DCF which, while known as the fourth year, is redeemable any time (and does not need to be used in consecutive semesters) over the following three years.</p>
<h5>Fourth Year</h5>
<p>In the fourth year, many students choose to stay in Berkeley and serve as a GSI as they prepare for an extended research trip. Since the DCF may be deferred until the sixth year, students often find that saving that fellowship and teaching in the fourth year helps them conduct library and other research at UC Berkeley before embarking on extended trips away. The fourth year is also when some students begin to apply for extramural fellowships to support their dissertation research.</p>
<h5>Fifth Year</h5>
<p>Like the fourth year, the fifth is variable according to an individual's research schedule. Often this is a good year to use the DCF while in the field conducting research. This is also the time, if research is complete and writing has begun, to apply for finishing fellowships and extramural dissertation awards.</p>
<h5>Sixth Year and Beyond</h5>
<p>In the sixth year, students who do not have extramural or remaining campus or departmental fellowship support will return to the classroom to teach while completing the dissertation and entering the job market. Others teach as adjunct faculty at the many colleges and universities in the area, and some find research assistantships to fund the final year(s).</p>
<h4 class="Normal1">Subfields</h4>
<h5>American Politics</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Gabriel Lenz</p>
<p>The study of American politics at Berkeley brings together faculty and graduate students who seek to tackle the most important questions confronting the field using diverse methodological approaches.</p>
<p>Among other topics, the faculty’s research agenda encompasses the quality and meaning of representation in contemporary American politics, the political implications of rising economic inequality, the politics of immigration and of minority group representation, the meaning of American national identity, the sources and implications of party polarization, the development of American bureaucratic government and of the American welfare state, and the balance of power among Congress, the Presidency, and the Courts. Our program strives to train students to have a diverse methodological toolkit, including quantitative, historical/developmental, game theoretic, behavioral, and institutional approaches.</p>
<p>The Institute of Governmental Studies and Survey Research Center support several workshops and colloquia that foster this diverse intellectual community, including the American Politics Research Workshop, the Positive Political Theory seminar series, the Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration Colloquium, the American Political Development working group, and the Quantitative Methods Workshop. These research units also provide funding for graduate student research projects and for faculty-student collaboration. Faculty work closely with students to help each student carve out a research agenda that fits his or her interests, while addressing a substantively important problem.</p>
<h5>Comparative Politics</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: M. Steven Fish</p>
<p>Berkeley has a longstanding tradition of distinction in comparative politics. Members of the department’s comparative politics faculty are widely recognized as national and international leaders, and the department’s strengths have grown in recent years.</p>
<p>Coverage of substantive themes, methodological approaches, and geographic expertise is extremely broad. Comparative political economy, political regimes and regime change, political parties and organizations, and social mobilization are the subject of great interest among faculty and graduate students. Some comparative faculty and graduate students rely largely upon formal theory in their work. Some are highly proficient in quantitative methods, while others use case studies and qualitative methods. Many faculty and graduate students use multi-method approaches. The faculty emphasizes rigor of method—whether applied in formal, statistical, or qualitative work. All graduate students in comparative politics are expected to achieve proficiency in all methods prevalent in the field.</p>
<p>The faculty and graduate student population is diverse; no single theoretical orientation or methodology enjoys status as orthodoxy. Generally speaking, Berkeley comparativists pursue “big” questions that have broad implications for political life and public policy as well as social science. Such questions include when and why Chinese peasants resist unjust authority; why the Chinese economy has grown so rapidly and what other countries can learn from it; how transformations in the global economy are reshaping the welfare state in advanced industrialized countries; how economic structures and resource flows mold state and market institutions in the Middle East; why economic liberalization has proved difficult in Japan and how it may yet come about; why democracy is failing in Russia while working in Indonesia; why opposition forces succeed in forging electoral alliances in some African polities but not others; how party systems influence the provision of public goods across the Indian states; and how labor organizations are responding to transformations in economic policy in Latin America.</p>
<h5>International Relations</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Vinod Aggarwal</p>
<p>International Relations at Berkeley focuses on the study of contemporary and historical problems in world politics. Our faculty and graduate students work on an eclectic set of substantive issues that frequently cross over between international relations theory, security studies, and international political economy.</p>
<p>Current research interests pursued by our group include the causes and consequences of peace and war, the political economy of trade and finance, American foreign and national security policy, emerging issues in security, geopolitical order and change, the impact of technology and geography on world politics, the role of ideas and identities shaping international affairs, the link between business and politics, and the interaction between religion and global politics. In addition to resources in the Political Science Department, our work is reflected and supported by various centers across campus:  the Institute for International Studies (IIS), the Berkeley Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Study Center (BASC), the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy (BRIE), the Religion, Politics and Globalization Program (RPGP), and others. In addition, the journal <em>Business and Politics</em> is edited by one of our faculty members.</p>
<p>Our methodologies are equally eclectic, ranging from socio-historical analysis to quantitative empirics and formal modeling. Much of our research is interdisciplinary, drawing from fields as disparate as economics, psychology, ecology, theology, or history. We take theory seriously but not to the exclusion of interesting and important global problems. Our overarching goal is to contribute to an understanding of how international politics is organized and how it functions around substantive issues that matter to political actors and human beings.</p>
<h5>Methodology &amp; Formal Theory</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Jasjeet Sekhon</p>
<p>The Berkeley program in empirical methodology and formal theory offers rigorous training that is carefully integrated with major substantive agendas in political science.</p>
<p>The program builds centrally on innovative faculty research, which encompasses new methods for causal inference and pro­gram evaluation, as well as statistical computing and survey analysis. The work on surveys has included path-breaking contri­butions to developing and refining ex­periments embedded in surveys and computer-assisted telephone inter­view­ing; and innovations in measuring issue orientations and in multi-level modeling of political behavior. In formal theory, faculty have contributed to opening new lines of inquiry into strategic interactions where formal institutions are weak, and to modeling information and incentives in organiza­tions—as they affect both the dynamics of institutions within the United States and those in authoritarian and democratizing regimes. Faculty in both tradi­tions play a promi­nent role in developing empirical tests of formal theory, based on both laboratory experiments and obser­va­tional data. The faculty has also done influential work on qua­litative meth­odology, compa­rative-historical methods, and linking qualitative methods with both quantitative tools and with formal analysis.</p>
<p>The methods/formal faculty makes important institutional contributions on the Berkeley campus. They convene the Positive Political Theory Seminar, which draws together a national consti­tuency of leading modelers for its biweekly meetings. They have led the campus Survey Research Center and helped to sustain its innovative research on survey methodo­logy; and they were central to launching the Berkeley’s NSF/IGERT training program in Politics, Economics, Psychology, and Public Policy (PEPPP). Berkeley’s Institute of Govern­mental Studies, as well as the Survey Research Center, are important venues for convening scholars and graduate students, and they provide support for graduate students pursuing methodological and formal training.</p>
<p>Faculty members also play leading roles in the national political science profession. Their contri­butions have included serving as Chair of the Board of the American National Elections Studies (ANES); providing crucial leadership in launching the NSF program on the Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM); co-editing the new Oxford Handbook of Political Methodology; serving as President of the Political Methodology Society; and founding APSA’s Organized Section for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research. The political science department maintains close ties with the national Institute for Qualitative/Multi-Method Research, and many graduate students attend the institute. Three of the methods/formal faculty are Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<h5>Political Theory &amp; Philosophy</h5>
<p>Subfield Coordinator: Kinch Hoekstra</p>
<p>Berkeley’s department offers a full range of courses in political theory, including classical, modern, and contemporary political philosophy (both European and American).</p>
<p>In the history of political thought, faculty have particular strengths in ancient moral and political thought, renaissance and early modern political thought, Enlightenment social and political thought, and nineteenth and twentieth century Marxism, British and Continental theory, and critical theory. In contemporary political theory, their areas of expertise include liberal and democratic thought, sovereignty and multiculturalism, and postfoundational approaches to subjectivity and social inquiry.</p>
<p>The core curriculum for graduate study in the department involves those courses recommended in preparation for the qualifying exam in the history of political thought (such courses include <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL SCI 212A" title="POL&#160;SCI&#160;212A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 212A');">POL&#160;SCI&#160;212A</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL SCI 212B" title="POL&#160;SCI&#160;212B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 212B');">POL&#160;SCI&#160;212B</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL SCI 212C" title="POL&#160;SCI&#160;212C" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 212C');">POL&#160;SCI&#160;212C</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL SCI 213" title="POL&#160;SCI&#160;213" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 213');">POL&#160;SCI&#160;213</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL SCI 214" title="POL&#160;SCI&#160;214" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 214');">POL&#160;SCI&#160;214</a></span>); and courses of special relevance to the qualifying exam in contemporary political theory (including <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL SCI 215A" title="POL&#160;SCI&#160;215A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 215A');">POL&#160;SCI&#160;215A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL SCI 215B" title="POL&#160;SCI&#160;215B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 215B');">POL&#160;SCI&#160;215B</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL SCI 216" title="POL&#160;SCI&#160;216" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI 216');">POL&#160;SCI&#160;216</a></span>). The history of political thought exam has two parts. Part I queries students about the nature of the history of Western political thought as a field of knowledge, and/or about debates focused on particular periods or problems. Part II of the exam asks students to respond to questions about particular theorists or texts in each of three major time periods (ancient and medieval; early modern; modern). The contemporary political thought exam approaches twentieth and twenty-first century political theory from three angles: subfields of theory, theorists and approaches, and topics.</p>

<p>The research, writing, and pedagogical interests of faculty within political theory are impressively varied. Greater details about the work and interests of each faculty member may be found on their faculty web pages.</p>
<h5>Models &amp; Politics</h5>
<p>Formal models are used in political science as abstract representations of political institutions and choices in order to focus attention on key logics and causal mechanisms in a political process. Good modeling requires fluency in technical fields such as game theory and social choice theory, as well as the substantive knowledge to craft an appropriate and insightful model for a specific application.</p>
<p>The Models &amp; Politics subfield, instituted by the faculty in 2007, connects advanced training in formal modeling techniques (also commonly referred to as formal theory, positive political theory, or political economy) with innovative substantive research in political science. It is designed for students who plan to make significant use of formal modeling in their own research in American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, or Political Theory. This subfield is appropriate for students who wish to use formal models to structure and inform their empirical research, as well as those who wish to become pure modelers.</p>
<h5>Political Behavior</h5>
<p>Political behavior at UC Berkeley serves as a bridge between political science on the one side and political psychology and political sociology on the other. Its focus is on the social and psychological processes by which individuals (and groups) engage in political life. Although the actual studies of these matters may occur within a particular geographical or institutional context and data are most often drawn from the American experience, the purpose is to generalize to a class of political phenomena or behavior beyond specific countries or specific institutions. Attention is also paid to problems of survey design and analysis, the development of scales, indices, and other measurement devices, questionnaire construction, interviewing, sampling, and other elements of systematic research that aim to yield data susceptible to statistical analysis. Among the substantive topics covered in the field are: public opinion; political leadership; political participation and protest and personality and politics.</p>
<h5>Public Law &amp; Jurisprudence</h5>
<p>Public Law is concerned with the analysis of the actual behavior of legal decision-makers and the law-related behavior of citizens, as well as with the study of legal and constitutional doctrine. It seeks to develop an understanding of the role of law, legal theory and legal practice in the governmental process. Courses and faculty research focus primarily on how the actions of legal decision-makers (like judges, police, regulatory officials, and bureaucrats) are shaped both by legal doctrine and philosophy and by political, organizational, economic, and social variables. Students are also expected to develop a knowledge of American Constitutional Law, its political ramifications, and its relation to public theory. Joint work with the UC Berkeley School of Law and its program in Jurisprudence and Social Policy is encouraged.</p>
<h5>Public Policy &amp; Organization</h5>
<p>Public policy studies explore political responses to specific public problems, like environmental degradation, poverty, or disease. Faculty in this subfield are interested in the political dynamics of policy-making and policy implementation, including such topics as agenda-setting, regulatory decision-making, and federalism. Since public problems often ignore jurisdictions, a policy-oriented approach to political science is often concerned about the interplay between different levels of government (local, regional, national, and international). The Public Policy &amp; Organization subfield therefore draws on, and contributes to, scholarship in urban politics, American politics, comparative politics, and international relations.</p>
<p>Policy outcomes are typically mediated by organizations that mobilize stakeholders, make authoritative decisions, administer programs, and enforce laws. These organizations range from complex government bureaucracies to professional associations and social movement organizations. The organizational and inter-organizational aspects of policy-making and policy implementation are a particular concern of this subfield. Important debates in this field often focus on understanding how specific institutional arrangements are created to govern policy arenas and on whether these institutions produce effective, efficient, and equitable governance.</p>
<p>Sophisticated explanations of policy-making and implementation call for specific analytical tools and intellectual frameworks. This subfield draws on theories of policy-making and implementation, governance, public administration, public law, institutionalism, and organization theory as a framework of analysis.</p>

This course provides an introduction to research design in comparative politics; it is the second semester of the two-semester introductory graduate sequence for the comparative<br/>
sub-field. We will focus on various topics relevant to doing research, such as how to formulate research questions; develop concepts and measures; bolster the validity of descriptive and causal inferences; and use various qualitative and quantitative methods</span><span class="deschide"> in the service of diverse substantive agenda. Developing the ability to critique research is one important objective. However, the primary goal of the course is to provide a first foundation for actually doing research.

New digital technologies, changing market structures, and innovative business organizations are transforming the economic and social landscape of the advanced industrial countries. The policy issues associated with this transformation pose fundamental philosophical and political questions of how to organize our markets, polity, and society. The means of making and implementing these choices is politics. The necessarily global scope of the E-conomy</span><span class="deschide"> extends the political and policy challenges to the international arena. This course will explore the literature on the political economy of the Internet to determine what policy choices -- hence which political debates -- are and will be most important. We also will examine our conceptual understanding of the burgeoning digital economy and its impact on politics, law, and socio-economic relations.

This graduate seminar is designed to introduce students to the comparative study of political violence. The course examines two broad themes through a variety of theoretical and empirical approaches. The first theme focuses on why individuals choose to rebel: When does violence become a strategy for resolving conflict? Why do individuals participate in violence? How is violence organized? The second theme focuses on how states choose to repress</span><span class="deschide"> citizens: When are human rights violations committed? When does a state use violence over other strategies? What are the effects of state violence?

This seminar provides an introduction to the major debates in comparative political economy. Although the empirical focus is on the affluent democracies, many of the debates and issues analyzed have implications for other regions. The course is divided into two main parts. The first part examines leading theoretical perspectives on political economy, such as Friedman, Marx, Weber, and Polanyi. The second part of the course is more topical. It</span><span class="deschide"> probes a number of examples of economic development, crisis, and change, with an eye to assessing alternative theoretical perspectives.

With changes in technology, the internationalization of production and the massive increase in trans-border transactions of all kinds, it has been argued that we live and work in an era of substantively different capitalism. Were this true, it has deep implications for politics and for political economy. This graduate seminar explores the validity of this claim of a &quot;new capitalism&quot; through a variety of materials, starting with the</span><span class="deschide"> question of whether &quot;Fordism&quot; ever existed, moving on to the question of whether &quot;Post-Fordism&quot; exists and ending with a variety of ethnographic studies that show how global production chains shape culture, gender, and hieraarchy/power.

How has religion shaped the structure of the international system? How should IR scholars approach the role that religion plays in contemporary affairs? How does religion constrain or motivate international conflict? This seminar seeks to guide students through readings in the social sciences, from psychology and sociology to anthropology and political science, that explore the intersection of religion and international relations. We will examine a variety</span><span class="deschide"> of theoretical approaches to the topic of religion and global politics, explore religious origins of the modern state system, and analyze the influence of religion on historical and comtemporary conflicts, with a particular focus on ethnic conflict, terrorism, and peacemaking.

This seminar will cover the topic of international cooperation. We will begin by reviewing the positions of central IR paradigms on the possibility of international cooperation and the role of international institutions. We will talk about why states want to cooperate, which obstacles need to be overcome, and how international institutions can facilitate interstate cooperation. We examine questions concerning the design of international institutions, the extent</span><span class="deschide"> of compliance they evoke, and their effect in various areas of international cooperation. We also discuss how domestic politics affect a state’s willingness to cooperate and comply with international institutions.

This course presents essential methodological concepts, ideas, and tools students need to know before beginning their study of the formal and quantitative methods tools used in political science research. Topics covered include functions, limits, continuity, calculus, optimization, probability and statistics, and linear algebra. Entire courses are often devoted to each of these topics (e.g., <a href="/search/?P=MATH 1A" title="MATH&#160;1A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 1A');">MATH&#160;1A</a>-1B, 53, 54; Stat 101, 134, 135), and this course</span><span class="deschide"> clearly cannot provide an equally comprehensive treatment. Rather, the class selectively focuses on specific mathematical concepts that are most commonly used in applied formal and quantitative work in political science. The goal of the class is to ensure that students have a sufficiently firm understanding of these critical ideas and facility with them that subsequent methods course can build on the foundation.

The course will study public policy in its connection with business. Policy is seen as an endogenous outcome of a game where diverse political forces try to shape public decisions to their advantage. The focus is broad, covering both theory and evidence. The aim is to analyze how a wide range of political institutions and processes affect public policy and economic performance. The ultimate goal of the course is to acquaint students with the topics at hand</span><span class="deschide">, and to consolidate their control of formal theory and quantitative techniques by discussing their application to the subject.

This course introduces diverse methodological tools, following the premise that all methods are strengthened if linked to qualitative analysis. Explores alternative approaches to concept formation, measurement, and causal inference, based on large- and small-N analysis and case studies. Analytic tensions that motivate the course derive from, among other sources, the pressure on case-study and small-N researchers to strive for analytic rigor</span><span class="deschide"> and generality; and the skepticism of some statisticians about quantitative inference - both descriptive and casual - in social science.

This graduate seminar is designed to introduce students to the comparative study of ethnic politics. It provides an overview of theoretical questions and methodological innovations across five topics: the conceptualization and measurement of ethnicity; the sources of ethnic mobilization and cleavage choice; the consequences of ethnic mobilization for democratization and democracy; the impact of ethnicity on redistributive politics; and the relationship between ethnicity</span><span class="deschide"> and patterns of violence ranging from urban riots to civil wars. Readings for each topic are drawn from various political science subfields as well as from other disciplines. They also reflect a range of regional contexts, including Eastern Europe, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of the course is to provide graduate students with a basis for undertaking their own original research on questions relating to ethnic politics. It should enable them to critically engage recent scholarship, understanding which theories have yet to be adequately tested and which theoretically interesting questions have yet to be asked.

This course analyzes the politics of social protection in Western Europe and the United States. After describing different national welfare regimes, we turn to contemporary challenges, notably globalization, persistent poverty, and changes in family forms and gender roles. We also look at the politics of welfare retrenchment and adjustment, paying particular attention to the prospects for progressive social policy. Must reform inevitably scale</span><span class="deschide"> back protections for the weak and vulnerable, or can equity be safeguarded while promoting efficiency?

This course explores the implications of new strategies for coping with social problems and managing public programs. In response to growing criticism of government bureaucracy, public skepticism of expert authority, and an explosion of advocacy groups, a variety of new governance strategies have been developed. These new strategies are characterized by five broad themes: the use of markets or market mechanisms to increase efficiency; an emphasis on holding</span><span class="deschide"> public agencies accountable and making them more transparent; the development of coordinating networks to link public agencies with each other and with stakeholders; the extensive involvement of non-state organizations in all aspects of governing; and renewed attention to the civic role of individuals and communities. The course investigates the extent to which these new strategies succeed in making the governance process more efficient, accountable, effective, representative, and civic.
