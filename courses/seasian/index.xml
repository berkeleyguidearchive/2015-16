In postcolonial thought on European claims to cultural supremacy, the case of the &quot;Dutch East-Indies&quot; (the future Indonesia) still arouses questions like: What made the Dutch colonial policy different from that of other European powers? What were the main characteristics of the &quot;Dutch East-Indies&quot;? How did a small country like the Netherlands manage to rule a territory</span><span class="deschide"> that was fifty-two times its own in scale? And how can we explain that 350 years of Dutch domination left so few traces in contemporary Indonesia?
