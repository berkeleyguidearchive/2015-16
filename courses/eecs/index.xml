This course introduces students to the basics of modeling, analysis, and design of embedded, cyber-physical systems. Students learn how to integrate computation with physical processes to meet a desired specification. Topics include models of computation, control, analysis and verification, interfacing with the physical world, real-time behaviors, mapping to platforms, and distributed embedded systems. The course has a strong laboratory component</span><span class="deschide">, with emphasis on a semester-long sequence of projects.

An introduction to digital and system design. The material provides a top-down view of the principles, components, and methodologies for large scale digital system design. The underlying CMOS devices and manufacturing technologies are introduced, but quickly abstracted to higher-levels to focus the class on design of larger digital modules for both FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) and ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). The</span><span class="deschide"> class includes extensive use of industrial grade design automation and verification tools for assignments, labs and projects.<br/>
The class has two lab options: ASIC Lab (EECS&#160;151LA) and FPGA Lab (EECS&#160;151LB). Students must enroll in at least one of the labs concurrently with the class.

This lab lays the foundation of modern digital design by first presenting the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. The labs are centered on a large design with the focus on rapid design space exploration. The lab exercises culminate with a project design, e.g., implementation of a three-stage RISC-V processor with a register file and caches.
