This course first surveys the basics of fixed income: terminology, security types, debt and money markets. Attention then moves to the valuation of cash flows, term structure of interest rates and modeling of credit risk. Building on that foundation, the course then examines the key role that fixed income plays in the global financial system, other asset classes and derivatives. The course is firmly grounded in a quantitative</span><span class="deschide"> and analytical approach, with each topic placed in the relevant real world context -- for example, the role that high yield securities play in an LBO, and negotiation of bond covenants. The course is at the more quantitative end of the MBA curriculum, with a large focus on bond math, including duration and convexity.

This course introduces the world of operational and strategic turnarounds of troubled and underperforming businesses. It focuses on the leadership practices that work in fixing flawed enterprises, from underperforming businesses to those on the brink of a death spiral. Most time in the course is spent learning how to more effectively lead companies that are underperforming or in trouble. The course is taught by cases</span><span class="deschide">, with the view that the best way to learn leadership is by taking the perspective of business leaders facing crises that demand new direction. Since a rescue plan only works if it is embraced, students take various roles in the cases, including bosses, subordinates, boards and lenders.
