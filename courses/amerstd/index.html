Inspired by Raymond Williams’ classic text, Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, and the recent Keywords of American Cultural Studies (Burgett and Hendler), this course will provide a short and focused introduction to central terms and debates in American Studies. The goal is: (1) to enable each student to develop a critical understanding of a key concept such as “Race,” “Representation</span><span class="deschide">,” “Class,” and “Democracy': (2) allow students to become familiar with some of the major scholarly works on the keyword; and (3) introduce students to the kind of interdisciplinary inquiry that characterizes our American Studies program.<br/>

The Great Depression and World War II are arguably the two most influential events for the development of the built environment in the 20th century. Not only did they alter the socio-economic and political landscape on which architecture and urban planning depend, but they also led to technological innovations and vital debates about the built environment.

World War II lifted the U.S. from the Great Depression and launched a long economic boom that helped underwrite and propel efforts on behalf of greater racial equality and economic equity. As that boom began to fade in the late 1960s, America’s march toward greater racial equality foundered, while its march toward greater economic equity began to reverse course. The Civil Rights Era gave way to the New Gilded Age. This course will explore the political</span><span class="deschide">, legal, and economic history of America’s struggles for racial equality and economic equity – and the relationship between them.

This course will offer several perspectives on the role advertising has played in determining various expressions of American self-identity, with special emphasis on analyzing corporate representations of the self presented of--and directed to--African Americans and Native Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The course will complicate commercial representations of African Americans and Native Americans by comparing and contrasting these corporately</span><span class="deschide"> manufactured identities with individualized voices of racial photography, painting, and music of the period. The lectures and discussions will be designed to build comparatively and incrementally. Gender issues will constitute a subtext throughout the course.

This course will address the birth of advertising culture in the U.S., focusing on the specific ways that early advertising used images of Natives to connect products to values associated with nature, authenticity, and masculinity. We will then talk about the use of plantations and African Americans to both sell products and re-imagine the U.S. as a nation. Finally, we will look at the &quot;Golden</span><span class="deschide"> Age&quot; of advertising (1950-1980) to talk about the way that middle class Euro-American values came to define the American Dream.

In his famous essay, “Indian Humor,” Vine Deloria, Jr., argued that no social movement could succeed without the use of humor. This course takes up that claim by asking how American comedians have used racial and ethnic humor to advance political claims, mobilize social actions, and create specific vocabularies for addressing social conditions. The production of racial and ethnic humor operates</span><span class="deschide"> to both include and exclude populations. In addition to asking, Why is this funny?, the course will also explore who laughs and why. Resources will include satirical writings by Will Rogers; short stories by Sherman Alexie, including his revision of The Searchers in “Dear John Wayne”; stand-up comedy by Margaret Cho and others, film, and literature.

This course aims to uncover the long history between race, gender, nation, and the visual. Our particular concern is how visual culture produces meanings about African American, Native American, and women's bodies. What do visual narratives tell us about national identity? Through the specific lenses of visual art and photography, we will ask how do racial bodies become gendered bodies? How have</span><span class="deschide"> racial meanings and the visual modalities employed to express them changed over time?

This course examines the nature, function and status in contemporary American culture of a central metaphor and belief in American experience: human life as a journey to the west, to the east, or to nowhere. We will study the nature and extent of this motif in recent American culture (including its expression in literature, music, and popular idioms) as well as situate our discussions within the context of historical expressions of the American journey as cyclical</span><span class="deschide">, eschatological, or as a journey to oblivion. Drawing on selections from, among others, Walt Whitman, Josiah Royce, James Baldwin, Jack Kerouac, and Maya Angelou, we will discuss the notion of journey in terms of possibility, nostalgia, nectar, cynicism, self-deception, and disappointment. Students will be encouraged to consider--and write about--their own relation to this expressive tradition in American cultural history.

Chinatown occupies a permanent space in major North American cities. This space occupies a special place in the imagination of white U.S. and Canadian settlers, inspiring curiosity and fear and provoking missionary zeal and racial antagonism. Chinatown has emerged variously as an exotic Oriental city, guilded ghetto, slum, and metaphor for intrigue and corruption. We will explore the images and realities of Chinatown in history and in American imagination (represented</span><span class="deschide"> by literature and films).

This course will explore the history of California in terms of Angel Island in San Francisco Bay. The island will be the central reference point and illustration for many of the changes that have taken place in the demographics, environment, and politics of California. Beginning with the earliest inhabitants, students will follow the fortunes and misfortunes of the diverse peoples who have come to call themselves Californians. The course will examine specifically</span><span class="deschide"> the culture and lifestyle of the Coast Miwok Indians, the period of Spanish colonial and Mission administrations, and the later displacement of Spanish-speaking Californios by Anglos as California became a state of the U.S. Students will also consider the impact of national affairs on the island and California as it became in turn a military base and recruitment center for the Civil War and Indian campaigns and then an immigration station. It was as an immigration station that Angel Island had the most profound effect on individual lives and for which the island is now known. Finally, students will focus on Chinese exclusion and immigration.

San Francisco Chinatown: Oriental city? Gilded ghetto? Or just Old Gold Mountain and home base to its Chinese American residents? This course aims to go against and beyond the gilded facade and exotic mystery of San Francisco's leading tourist attraction by taking an inside look at the history and culture of a complex community constantly in flux. We will review the socioeconomic and political conditions that shaped the formation and development of San Francisco's</span><span class="deschide"> Chinatown and the lives of its people from the community's beginnings in the 1850's to the present day. In the process, we will also examine how distinct social institutions and Chinatown culture developed in response to life in America, particularly to immigration policies, the anti-Chinese movement, acculturation and assimilation forces, new gender roles and relationships, and U.S.-China politics. There will be an opportunity to learn about San Francisco Chinatown first-hand as the instructor, who is a native of that community, will take the class on a field trip.

This course will give close attention to three works which have been essential to the making of an African American literary tradition: Frederick Douglass's (1845), Zora Neale Hurston's (1937), and Alice Walker's (1982). It would help if students also read Richard Wright's story (1945). In addition to attending to the literary-cultural context of these works, we will explore other writing by these authors and develop comparisons with other African American literature.</span><span class="deschide">

Westward expansion and the frontier experience have long assumed a mythical status as formative events in the annals of American culture, providing Americans with a collective cultural history and space for fantasy. Within this story there has been little room for women: westward expansion has been encoded as a male activity, and the American West has served a proving ground for the definition of American manhood. However, recent research on frontier</span><span class="deschide"> women's history has shown that white and non-white women were present on all frontiers and in all phases of American expansion to the West. Moreover, white, literate women wrote copiously in, on, and about western frontiers--in letters and diaries, travel and settlement narratives, reminiscences and autobiographies, poems, stories, and novels. Reading from a diversity of women's texts, we will explore gender together with race and class in order to understand the women's frontier. This course will roughly follow a chronological line from the 1830s into the first decades of the 20th century.

European images of the exotic existed long before 1492. After Columbus, they were applied to people of the Americas who were thus turned into objects of fear and desire. While these images were modified over the centuries, basic elements of positive, and negative stereotyping connected with notions of race, gender, and environmental conditioning have persisted to the present day. This class will study a selection of European and North American literary</span><span class="deschide"> texts from the late 18th century to the present, focusing on the discourse of culture, alterity, and identity as well as, on such aspects as the Romantic idealization of &quot;natural man,&quot; savagism, natural nobility, communicational boundaries, and forms of cultural hybridity.

American society is fragmented, divided, and often polarized. Race, class, and at times culture serve as boundaries which separate and reinforce distinctions, creating many different Americas within the U.S. How one sees America tends to be intimately related to the environment in which one lives, the social status and class one occupies, and the historical experience of the individual or the group with which one identifies. Yet, there are also forces which bind</span><span class="deschide"> Americans together and which have produced a culture that transcends various forms of difference to create a common American identity. This course will explore the nature of those forces that divide and unite the peoples of the U.S. Through literature, film, and social science, we will attempt to identify the ingredients of the glue that holds this society together and gives the concept of America meaning.

Film scholar Frank McConell wrote, &quot;Each era chooses the monster it deserves and projects,&quot; which is to say that sources of fright are not universal but contingent, culturally and temporally specific. This course will study the changing face of horror in the U.S., from the nineteenth century to the present. Students will begin with Freud's theory of the uncanny - a model which will inform</span><span class="deschide"> our examinations of various monsters depicted in literature, cinema, television, graphic fiction, and music.

This course is designed to encourage research skills, critical thinking, and effective writing. An intensive reading and research seminar, the course will assist students in the development of skills fundamental to advanced research in the humanities, social sciences, and cultural studies. In addition to examining some topics in current American studies scholarship, students will conduct semester-long research projects. The effort entails identification</span><span class="deschide"> of research topics, cultivation of interdisciplinary methodologies, compilation of annotated bibliographies, and completion of a literature review, which may serve as the first portion of the American studies senior thesis. The course is strongly recommended for those who have been out of touch with the conventions of academic research and writing or who might wish to pursue a graduate degree in the future.
