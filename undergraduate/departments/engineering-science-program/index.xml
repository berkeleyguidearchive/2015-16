<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The undergraduate Engineering Science Program is multidepartmental and interdisciplinary. The majors consist of closely related fields of the natural sciences, mathematics, physics, and engineering. The majors offered within the Engineering Science Program prepare students especially for advanced graduate study in engineering or the natural sciences. The four engineering science majors include engineering mathematics and statistics, engineering physics, and environmental engineering science, and energy engineering.</p>
<p>There are no graduate degrees offered through this program.</p>
