<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Operations Research and Management Science (ORMS) major is designed for students in the College of Letters &amp; Science. It provides a solid foundation in the quantitative, model building, and problem solving skills of operations research and management science. It also gives students the flexibility to learn more about a particular field of interest to them in which they can apply these skills.</p>
<p>The major is appropriate for students who enjoy and are good at mathematics, computers, and solving practical, multidisciplinary problems. Keep in mind that the program is very math-intensive. This may not be the right program for students who think math is a difficult subject.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can declare a major after they have completed at least one semester at UC Berkeley. The ORMS major is impacted. To be considered for admission, students should have a minimum of a 3.2 overall grade point average (GPA) in the prerequisite courses. Applications must be submitted by invitation only. To be considered for invitation, request to be added to the waiting list by contacting Anayancy Paz, 4145 Etcheverry Hall, <a href="mailto:anayancy@berkeley.edu">anayancy@berkeley.edu</a>
. The program plan cannot be approved if students will have completed more than 80 semester units prior to their last intended semester (AP units do not count towards this 80-unit ceiling).</p>

<p>All four prerequisite classes (<span class="sc_courseinline">MATH&#160;53</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline">MATH&#160;54</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline">ECON&#160;1</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline">ECON&#160;2</span> or <span class="sc_courseinline">ECON&#160;C3</span> and <span class="sc_courseinline">UGBA&#160;10</span>) must be completed prior to acceptance to the major and all must be taken for a letter grade. Students should apply to the major at the end of the semester in which they are enrolled in their final prerequisites. Transfer students should apply at the end of their first semester at Berkeley. Admissions decisions will not be made until any prerequisite courses in progress are finished and grades are available.</p>

<p>Many factors are considered in determining admission. The main criterion is academic performance as measured by the Berkeley GPA in the prerequisite courses. </p>
<p>The petition to declare a major is available from L&amp;S office in Campbell Hall or from the <span><a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/fp/fp.html" target="_blank">L&amp;S website</a>
.</span>
</p>

<p>Since this major is capped, it is a good idea to have a backup plan. There is an Operations Research concentration in the Math Department that might be a good choice, if students are not admitted to the ORMS major.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 overall and 3.7 in the major should consider participating in the ORMS honors program. To graduate with honors, a student must find a faculty sponsor appropriate for an original research project that he or she wishes to do and enroll in two semesters (6 units) of the honors thesis course.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a student may take two approved graduate courses in Operations Research or a related field, and achieve at least an A- in each course. The student must also maintain a minimum 3.5 overall GPA and 3.7 in the major.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Operations Research and Management Science.</p>

<p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass </em>basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
