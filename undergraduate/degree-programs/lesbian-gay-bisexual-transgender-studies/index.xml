<h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The Department of Gender and Women’s Studies offers an innovative interdisciplinary undergraduate minor program in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) Studies. LGBT Studies works to establish sexuality as a crucial category of analysis in the humanities and social sciences. It draws on disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, psychology, history, literature, and cultural studies in order to document the extent to which sexuality itself is a complex cultural and historical phenomenon that bears careful examination. Just as Women's Studies, for instance, is not only by, about, and for women, LGBT Studies is not only by, about, or for lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people, but rather it includes all humanity in its purview.</p>
<p>A large portion of the energy spent developing this field has been devoted to discovering (and recovering) the history, dynamics, and complexities of same-sex relationships. Both those relationships and their study have had to combat a variety of delegitimizing forces originating from numerous social locations. The study of same-sex relationships within LGBT Studies has intended to provide legitimacy to those kinds of relationships, to the communities of people organized around and involved in those relationships, and to the history of those people and those communities. In working toward this end, the field of LGBT Studies has necessarily worked to theorize the concept, practice, and history of sexuality itself. It has learned to examine the various ways intimacies and sexual experiences are constructed and perceived in different periods, cultures, and social classes. The field of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies thus both addresses the particularities of the modern forms of sexuality we call lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (forms of sexuality that have only recently been able to claim for themselves the right to serious academic study) and further addresses the phenomenon of sexuality itself in all its historical and cross-cultural diversity.</p>
<p>There is currently no major program in LGBT Studies. Students interested in pursuing studies in this field at the major level should consider the major in <a href="/2015-16/undergraduate/degree-programs/gender-womens-studies/">Gender and Women's Studies</a>
.</p>

<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>To declare the minor, students must fill out the <a href="http://womensstudies.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/LGBT%20MINOR%20WORKSHEET.pdf" target="_blank">LGBT Intent to Minor Form</a>
 once they have decided to minor in the program. After fulfilling all course requirements, students must complete a <a href="http://womensstudies.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Completion%20of%20L%26S%20Minor%20form.pdf" target="_blank">Completion of L &amp; S Minor form</a>
 and submit it to the GWS undergraduate adviser in 608 Barrows Hall. </p>

<p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>

<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
