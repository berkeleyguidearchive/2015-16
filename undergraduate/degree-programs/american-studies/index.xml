<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The goal of the American Studies interdisciplinary major is to enable students learn a set of research, critical thinking, and written and oral communication skills that will enable them to become self-conscious and thoughtful investigators of American society. To meet this basic goal, our courses are designed to give students a basic understanding of American history, culture, political economy, social structures, and environment (both natural and constructed), as well as to enable them to use a range of concepts and methods to define and analyze significant problems, issues, and questions relating to American life. Through a close reading of diverse texts and physical and cultural materials, American Studies students learn how to critically analyze how individuals, groups, and a wide variety of political, economic, and cultural institutions have interacted to shape and give meaning to the American experience.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Research Skills:
	<ul>
		<li>Students learn how to locate and evaluate primary source materials and secondary texts. These include published contemporary and historical documents, artifacts of material culture, landscape and architectural structures, visual and auditory media, oral history, and folklore.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Critical Thinking Skills:
	<ul>

		<li>Students learn to analyze and understand the American past so as to gain perspective on and critical understanding of current issues and problems in American life (i.e., to understand and think critically about American society from an historical perspective, which by definition integrates humanities and social science approaches).</li>
		<li>Students learn to critically analyze and interpret the meaning of American material culture and its built and natural environments (i.e., understand and think critically about American society from the perspectives of the knowledges embodied in the disciplines of geography, architecture, landscape architecture, environmental studies, and art).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Written and Oral Communication Skills
	<ul>
		<li>Students learn how to communicate effectively in written form, demonstrating the ability to formulate a well organized argument supported by evidence.</li>

World War II lifted the U.S. from the Great Depression and launched a long economic boom that helped underwrite and propel efforts on behalf of greater racial equality and economic equity. As that boom began to fade in the late 1960s, America’s march toward greater racial equality foundered, while its march toward greater economic equity began to reverse course. The Civil Rights Era gave way to the New Gilded Age.

In his famous essay, “Indian Humor,” Vine Deloria, Jr., argued that no social movement could succeed without the use of humor. This course takes up that claim by asking how American comedians have used racial and ethnic humor to advance political claims, mobilize social actions, and create specific vocabularies for addressing social conditions. The production of racial and ethnic humor operates</span><span class="deschide"> to both include and exclude populations. In addition to asking, Why is this funny?, the course will also explore who laughs and why. Resources will include satirical writings by Will Rogers; short stories by Sherman Alexie, including his revision of The Searchers in “Dear John Wayne”; stand-up comedy by Margaret Cho and others, film, and literature.

This course examines the nature, function and status in contemporary American culture of a central metaphor and belief in American experience: human life as a journey to the west, to the east, or to nowhere. We will study the nature and extent of this motif in recent American culture (including its expression in literature, music, and popular idioms) as well as situate our discussions within the context of historical expressions of the American journey as cyclical</span><span class="deschide">, eschatological, or as a journey to oblivion. Drawing on selections from, among others, Walt Whitman, Josiah Royce, James Baldwin, Jack Kerouac, and Maya Angelou, we will discuss the notion of journey in terms of possibility, nostalgia, nectar, cynicism, self-deception, and disappointment. Students will be encouraged to consider--and write about--their own relation to this expressive tradition in American cultural history.

Chinatown occupies a permanent space in major North American cities.

This course will explore the history of California in terms of Angel Island in San Francisco Bay. The island will be the central reference point and illustration for many of the changes that have taken place in the demographics, environment, and politics of California. Beginning with the earliest inhabitants, students will follow the fortunes and misfortunes of the diverse peoples who have come to call themselves Californians. The course will examine specifically</span><span class="deschide"> the culture and lifestyle of the Coast Miwok Indians, the period of Spanish colonial and Mission administrations, and the later displacement of Spanish-speaking Californios by Anglos as California became a state of the U.S. Students will also consider the impact of national affairs on the island and California as it became in turn a military base and recruitment center for the Civil War and Indian campaigns and then an immigration station. It was as an immigration station that Angel Island had the most profound effect on individual lives and for which the island is now known. Finally, students will focus on Chinese exclusion and immigration.

San Francisco Chinatown: Oriental city? Gilded ghetto? Or just Old Gold Mountain and home base to its Chinese American residents? This course aims to go against and beyond the gilded facade and exotic mystery of San Francisco's leading tourist attraction by taking an inside look at the history and culture of a complex community constantly in flux. We will review the socioeconomic and political conditions that shaped the formation and development of San Francisco's</span><span class="deschide"> Chinatown and the lives of its people from the community's beginnings in the 1850's to the present day. In the process, we will also examine how distinct social institutions and Chinatown culture developed in response to life in America, particularly to immigration policies, the anti-Chinese movement, acculturation and assimilation forces, new gender roles and relationships, and U.S.-China politics. There will be an opportunity to learn about San Francisco Chinatown first-hand as the instructor, who is a native of that community, will take the class on a field trip.

Westward expansion and the frontier experience have long assumed a mythical status as formative events in the annals of American culture, providing Americans with a collective cultural history and space for fantasy. Within this story there has been little room for women: westward expansion has been encoded as a male activity, and the American West has served a proving ground for the definition of American manhood. However, recent research on frontier</span><span class="deschide"> women's history has shown that white and non-white women were present on all frontiers and in all phases of American expansion to the West. Moreover, white, literate women wrote copiously in, on, and about western frontiers--in letters and diaries, travel and settlement narratives, reminiscences and autobiographies, poems, stories, and novels. Reading from a diversity of women's texts, we will explore gender together with race and class in order to understand the women's frontier. This course will roughly follow a chronological line from the 1830s into the first decades of the 20th century.

Students in this course will learn skills for doing research on the Internet, with particular emphasis on resources available through the World Wide Web. Taught in a computer lab and taking a broadly international approach to &quot;American Studies,&quot; the course will provide hands-on experience with locating, searching and evaluating information for specific research projects. Students will collaborate on compiling an annotated index of online American Studies</span><span class="deschide"> resources. NOTE: Students enrolling in this class should have a basic working knowledge of how to use both e-mail and a Web browser such as Netscape; students without this experience will be at a serious disadvantage. The course is also intended for individuals with a serious interest in American Studies. Due to the nature of the class, there is no required reading, but a list of recommended books and articles will be made available. The final exam will require each student to research a topic in American Studies, selected by the instructor, and report on his or her findings with a set of &quot;bookmarks&quot; (Internet addresses) and a brief summary of what was found. The exam will be conducted in class and turned in on floppy disk.

European images of the exotic existed long before 1492. After Columbus, they were applied to people of the Americas who were thus turned into objects of fear and desire. While these images were modified over the centuries, basic elements of positive, and negative stereotyping connected with notions of race, gender, and environmental conditioning have persisted to the present day. This class will study a selection of European and North American literary</span><span class="deschide"> texts from the late 18th century to the present, focusing on the discourse of culture, alterity, and identity as well as, on such aspects as the Romantic idealization of &quot;natural man,&quot; savagism, natural nobility, communicational boundaries, and forms of cultural hybridity.

American society is fragmented, divided, and often polarized. Race, class, and at times culture serve as boundaries which separate and reinforce distinctions, creating many different Americas within the U.S. How one sees America tends to be intimately related to the environment in which one lives, the social status and class one occupies, and the historical experience of the individual or the group with which one identifies. Yet, there are also forces which bind</span><span class="deschide"> Americans together and which have produced a culture that transcends various forms of difference to create a common American identity. This course will explore the nature of those forces that divide and unite the peoples of the U.S. Through literature, film, and social science, we will attempt to identify the ingredients of the glue that holds this society together and gives the concept of America meaning.

Law is commonly viewed as the human reflection of natural law, as what police and judges do, or as a form of politics. This course will explore law as a narrative form. The murder trial of the Native American Whitehawk, the American legal response to racial discrimination, and the recent murder trial of O.J. Simpson will illustrate this method of analysis.
