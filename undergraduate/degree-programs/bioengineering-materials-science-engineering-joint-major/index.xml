<h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record.</p>
<p><span>The Bioengineering/Materials Science and Engineering Joint Major is for students who have a keen interest in the field of biomaterials. Students will study the design and synthesis of novel materials that will define new paradigms in biomaterials from the molecular through macroscopic levels, and will also receive a broad–based learning experience that will include exposure to fundamental courses in engineering and life sciences. This joint major aims to allow the student to understand the interface between the two major fields. Students taking this double major will successfully compete for jobs in the field of biomaterials in academe, industry, and government.</span></p>
<h3><span>Admission to the Joint Major</span></h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">College of Engineering joint majors website</a>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for all work undertaken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

This course is intended for lower division students interested in acquiring a foundation in biomedicine with topics ranging from evolutionary biology to human physiology. The emphasis is on the integration of engineering applications to biology and health. The goal is for undergraduate engineering students to gain sufficient biology and human physiology fundamentals so that they are better prepared to study specialized topics, e.g., biomechanics</span><span class="deschide">, imaging, computational biology, tissue engineering, biomonitoring, drug development, robotics, and other topics covered by upper division and graduate courses in UC Berkeley departments of Molecular and Cell Biology, Integrative Biology, Bioengineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, and courses in the UC San Francisco Division of Bioengineering. The specific lecture topics and exercises will include the key aspects of genomics and proteomics as well as topics on plant and animal evolution, stem cell biomedicine, and tissue regeneration and replacement. Medical physiology topics include relevant engineering aspects of human brain, heart, musculoskeletal, and other systems.

The goal of this semester course is to present the issues of professional conduct in the practice of engineering, research, publication, public and private disclosures, and in managing professional and financial conflicts. The method is through historical didactic presentations, case studies, presentations of methods for problem solving in ethical matters, and classroom debates on contemporary ethical issues. The faculty will be drawn from national</span><span class="deschide"> experts and faculty from religious studies, journalism, and law from the UC Berkeley campus.

They should understand how to choose the appropriate biomedical sensor, instrumentation amplifier, number of bits, sampling rate, anti-aliasing filter, and DAQ system. They will learn how to design a low-noise instrumentation amplifier circuit. They should understand the crucial importance of suppressing 60 Hz and other interferences to acquire high quality low-level biomedical signals. They should understand the design principles of building, debugging.
</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will achieve knowledge and skills in biomedical signal acquisition. They will be assessed in their success with the Course Objectives through tests, homeworks, and laboratories. In particular, the tests will ensure that the students have absorbed the theoretical concepts. The laboratories will provide assessment of learning practical skills (e.g., building an ECG circuit).<br/>

This semester-long course introduces students to bioengineering project-based learning in small teams, with a strong emphasis on need-based solutions for real medical and research problems through prototype solution selection, design, and testing. The course is designed to provide a &quot;capstone&quot; design experience for bioengineering seniors. The course is structured around didactic lectures, and a textbook, from which assigned readings will</span><span class="deschide"> be drawn, and supplemented by additional handouts, readings, and lecture material. Where appropriate, the syllabus includes guest lectures from clinicians and practicing engineers from academia and industry. The course includes active learning through organized activities, during which teams will participate in exercises meant to reinforce lecture material through direct application to the team design project.
