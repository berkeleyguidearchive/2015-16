<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The mission of the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies is to enable students to learn about the cultures and civilizations of South and Southeast Asia. The department teaches 12 languages and is an indispensable resource for programs in many other departments and areas.</p>
<p>For undergraduate majors, the department stresses an interdisciplinary approach and expects students to specialize in one of three areas—literature, religion, or cultural history. To this end, there are two tracks for majors—one that emphasizes the study of civilization and does not require language and one that requires the students to do four semesters of language work in addition to more general studies. UC Berkeley has an extraordinary number of experts in many areas of South and Southeast Asian Studies, and students are encouraged to take advantage of relevant courses in departments such as history, music, political science, ethnic studies, art history, linguistics, gender and women’s studies and English. Qualified undergraduates are also encouraged to participate in graduate seminars.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>There are two tracks in the South and Southeast Asian Studies major—one that emphasizes the study of civilization and does not require language, and one that requires the students to do four semesters of language work in addition to more general studies. Within each track, students specialize in an area (South or Southeast Asia).</p>
<h4>Goals for the Language Track</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Students should have mastered the grammar (included complex grammatical features) of at least one South and Southeast Asian language (Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, Telugu for South Asia and Indonesian, Thai, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Khmer for Southeast). They should be able to read stories, newspapers, and the like in the modern language in which they specialize.</li>
	<li>They should be able to speak and get about using the language (if relevant) and to write simple prose in the modern language.</li>
	<li>For classic languages such as Sanskrit, students should have basic facility in reading a variety of different genres in the original, and they should be comfortable using standard resource materials such as dictionaries, traditional grammars, and on-line resources. They are also expected to be able to engage critically with the pertinent secondary sources relevant to the texts being read.</li>
	<li>They should have a sound knowledge of one culture or area of South or Southeast Asia.</li>
	<li>They should have a broad general acquaintance with either South or Southeast Asia including a good knowledge of cultural history, literature, and/or religion.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Goals for the Civilization Track</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Students should have a thorough understanding of the histories and culture of either South or Southeast Asia.</li>
	<li>In lieu of acquiring detailed knowledge of one of the cultural/linguistic areas of South or Southeast Asia, they are expected to deepen their mastery of cultural history or religion of South or Southeast Asia.</li>
	<li>They should specialize in a particular national tradition and/or in a particular approach to the region (historical, literary, art, performative).</li>
</ol>

In postcolonial thought on European claims to cultural supremacy, the case of the &quot;Dutch East-Indies&quot; (the future Indonesia) still arouses questions like: What made the Dutch colonial policy different from that of other European powers? What were the main characteristics of the &quot;Dutch East-Indies&quot;? How did a small country like the Netherlands manage to rule a territory</span><span class="deschide"> that was fifty-two times its own in scale? And how can we explain that 350 years of Dutch domination left so few traces in contemporary Indonesia?

This course is an advanced introduction to the major teachings of Indian Buddhism and their philosophical elaborations. We will cover the core tenets attributed to the Buddha, and the later doctrinal and scholastic developments that turned Buddhism into one of the principal philosophical traditions of India. For this we will read select primary sources—in principle, extracts of the scriptures and later</span><span class="deschide"> treatises—and academic articles and book chapters. Rather than offering a broad introductory survey of Buddhist traditions across space and time, this class is geared towards students who are already familiar with the basics of Buddhism and want to deepen their understanding of the principal teachings of Buddhism originating in India.

This course considers the co-option, reinterpretation and dissemination of sacred texts and religious practices in various political and cultural projects in India during the colonial and post-colonial periods. Students will be introduced to religious “reform” movements, cross-cultural debates during the colonial period, and how the concept of a secular state in post-Independence India has</span><span class="deschide"> shaped and continues to shape religious practice and public policy. Important themes include transformations in the role of women, debates around caste and “untouchability”, and religious conversions. Although the emphasis is on Hindu traditions, attention will also be given to other Indian traditions such as Islam, Christianity and Buddhism.

The aim of this course on the culture and history of Muslim communities and institutions in South Asia is to introduce students to the broad historical currents of the expansion of Islam in the Indian subcontinent, the nature of Muslim political authority, the interaction between religious communities, Islamic aesthetics and contributions to material culture, the varied engagements and</span><span class="deschide"> reactions of Muslims to colonial rule, and the contemporary concerns of South Asia's Muslims. While this is a lecture course, ample time will be set aside for discussion and the active engagement of participants will be expected. Lectures will be supplemented with visual material, music, and movies where possible.

This course is designed to provide a dual chronological and thematic approach to the study of one of the greatest empires in human civilization: the Mughal Empire. Although the bulk of this course will focus on the Mughal Empire during its heyday between the 1550s and the early 1700s, careful attention will be paid to the larger historical and geographical contexts that both enabled the emergence</span><span class="deschide"> and, ultimately, decentralization of Mughal power. In so doing, this course will not only study South Asia's complex history on its own terms but also examine the intricate web of political, economic, and social links that connected South Asia to the rest of the world. Simultaneously, this course will also pay particular attention to a series of common misconceptions that dog the study of pre-modern Islamic polities. Among them, the supposedly lesser role played by women in politics; the dogmatic and central role of Islam in &quot;Muslim&quot; states; and the economic and political superiority of Western Europe. Crucial to these questions also is an examination of the historiography and historiographical traditions that have come to define contemporary understanding of the Mughal Empire.

Whenever Pakistan comes up as a subject of sustained conversation in the US it usually is for all the wrong reasons: the worst nuclear proliferator in recent history, the refuge of Osama bin Laden, a major source of regional instability in South and Central Asia. Although Pakistan may be viewed with deep mistrust by US policy planners and the American public alike, this course seeks to remind us that it is also</span><span class="deschide"> a country of great political, economic, religious, and social complexity. This course will situate Pakistan in its historical, political, literary, religious, economic and social contexts with the hope that students will develop nuanced and deeply grounded perspectives on a country that in fact defies easy stereotypes.

This course seeks to interrogate the highly contentious and controversial issue of Hindu and Muslim religious nationalism (otherwise known as &quot;communalism&quot;) in South Asia. In so doing, we will interrogate the historical trajectory and development of religious nationalism from the colonial period through to the present. We will examine issues relating to the rise of (non-religious) nationalism</span><span class="deschide"> outside of South Asia; Hindu and Muslim relations in the pre-colonial period; colonial attempts to construct South Asia's past along religious lines; the dialectical interplay of early Hindu and Muslim religious nationalism; the interplay between secular and religious nationalism; different intellectual attempts to articulate notions of bounded religious communities; the success of religious nationalism in contemporary South Asia; and the implications of religious nationalism for the future of South Asia.

This course explores the history of yoga from the late Vedic period to its most recent formulation in American popular and consumer culture. It seeks to make students conversant in the key texts and philosophical innovations of yoga across time. But to better convey the complex nuances of yoga's historical development it approaches the subject</span><span class="deschide"> in three parts: it explores theories of origin leading up to the formation of yoga as a classical philosophical school; it focuses on specialists and medieval innovators as it examines sects, sadhus, and aberrant modes of practice; it explores the contemporary context as it investigates modern yoga's place in both popular imagination and the marketplace.

Unique among the heterodox religious traditions that were prominent on the Indian subcontinent prior to the common era, Jainism has maintained an unbroken presence of lay and mendicant communities for more than 2,500 years. Throughout this time nonviolence has remained the guiding principle of Jain ethics and practices. This course will examine the teachings and practices of Jainism through selected readings</span><span class="deschide"> from the Jain scriptures and commentaries (in translation) as well as secondary sources. The rise of later heterodoxies, particularly the Virasaivas in the South and the Nathas and Siddhas in the North, will also be discussed.

Students learn to read roadside signs, scholarly articles, and an entire Khmer novel. Topics include current events in Cambodia, Cambodian history and politics, and a basic overview of traditional Khmer literature.

Additional material beyond the Intermediate curriculum includes reading and analyzing historical folk tales, learning to discuss the rice-farming cycle, and acquiring the tools to discuss research and &quot;development&quot; work in Cambodia at a sophisticated level.

Students will read advanced texts dealing with the topics of politics and history. They will also gain exposure to traditional verse texts, and read, discuss, and undertake group projects based on a variety of modern Khmer short stories. As in the case with Intermediate Khmer, students will also undertake substantial independent study, culminating in a final oral presentation. However</span><span class="deschide">, the standard by which both written and oral material will be judged will be much higher for Advanced students. Special attention will be paid to formal speaking style and advanced grammatical structures in Khmer for all students, and colloquial spoken expression for non-native speakers.
